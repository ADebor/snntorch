snnTorch Documentation
======================================
snnTorch is a Python package for performing gradient-based learning with spiking neural networks.
Rather than reinventing the wheel, it sits on top of PyTorch and takes advantage of their GPU accelerated tensor 
computation. Pre-designed spiking neuron models are seamlessly integrated within the PyTorch framework and can be treated as recurrent activation units.
